## Problem 1
import and clean the data
```{r}
homicide_df =
  read.csv("./homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state),
    resolved = case_when(
           disposition =="Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
           disposition =="Open/No arrest" ~"unsolved",
           disposition =="Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
         )) %>% 
  relocate(city_state)%>%
  filter(city_state != "TulsaAL")
```
focus on Baltimore,MD
```{r}
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "BaltimoreMD")

baltimore_summary = 
  baltimore_df %>% 
  summarize(
    unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved"),
    n = n()
  )

baltimore_test = 
  prop.test(
  x = baltimore_summary %>% pull(unsolved),
  n = baltimore_summary %>% pull(n)
)

baltimore_test %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```
iterate across cities
```{r}
prop_test_function = function(city_df){
  
  city_summary = 
    city_df %>%
    summarize(
      unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved"),
      n = n()
      )
  
  city_test = 
    prop.test(
      x = city_summary %>% pull(unsolved),
      n = city_summary %>% pull(n)
      )
  
  return(city_test)
  
}

prop_test_function(baltimore_df)

homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "AlbuquerqueNM") %>% 
  prop_test_function()
```
iterate across all cities
```{r}
results_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  nest(data = uid:resolved) %>% 
  mutate(
    test_results = map(data,prop_test_function),
    tidy_results = map(test_results, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, tidy_results) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_results) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, starts_with("conf"))

results_df
```
another way of iteration
```{r}
homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved"),
    n = n()
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    test_results = map2(unsolved, n, prop.test),
    tidy_results = map(test_results, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, tidy_results) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_results) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, starts_with("conf"))
```
make plot
```{r}
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```
